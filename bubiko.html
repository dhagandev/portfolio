          <h2>What's Bubiko About?</h2>
          <p></p>
          <p class="lead mb-5">Bubiko is a 3D model made by Novaby based on ideas by Stephen Black and Sayuri Okayama. Bubiko is a screen test of sorts, a way of documenting the possibilities and challenges of AR cinematography. </p>
          <p class="lead mb-5">I worked with Stephen Black (check him out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/blacksteps/">here!</a>) on a last minute project to prepare Bubiko for the Mascot Hall of Fame and Perogi Festival. He wrote an amazing article (see <a href="">here!</a>) about the differences between displaying Facebook Spark and Facebook Camera. Stephen aims to be the Pixar of AR.</p>

          <h2>Biggest Challenges?</h2>
          <p></p>
          <p class="lead mb-5">I had never worked with AR prior to this project. When Stephen contacted me, he had less than 24 hours before he had to leave for his flight and needed to be able to display the 3D model of Bubiko on his ipad. From his experience, I needed access to a Mac computer to work with Facebook Spark.</p>
          <p class="lead mb-5">Unfortunately, I do not own a Mac. We learned that Facebook Spark will work on Windows for editting purposes. Exporting the project to the Spark Studio Player on the ipad proved to be a challenge; in the short time I had, I was only able to export it to Facebook Camera. I had a lot of fun learning to play with AR. </p>
          <p class="lead mb-5">I had Bubiko attached to the camera, so you could not move around her. In the last 30 minutes before Stephen had to leave, I tried to detach the model in order to allow Stephen to move the camera around while Bubiko stayed still. However given the short time, we were not able to get it working.</p>
