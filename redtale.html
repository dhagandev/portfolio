          <h2>What's Red Tale Narratives About?</h2>
          <p></p>
          <p class="lead mb-5">Red Tale Narratives is a tool to assist people interested in writing stories for video games. RTN organizes different story projects, different chapters of the story, the characters, dialogue, and story structure. RTN primarily focuses on developing interactive branching narratives. </p>
          <p class="lead mb-5">Interactive branching narratives are centered around choices. The player chooses an action or a piece of dialogue, and the player's experience of the story is changed. Red Tale Narratives allows new narrative designers to create these branching stories while maintaining organization clear enough for noncreative individuals to follow along.</p>

          <h2>Why make an app like this?</h2>
          <p></p>
          <p class="lead mb-5">Most tools like this are proprietary. Someone curious about the field or new to it cannot access these tools to try their hand at writing stories.</p>
          <p class="lead mb-5">The paid tools are expensive. To someone new and looking to explore, it can be painful to be willing to commit large sums of money to something you are unsure if you are interested in. </p>
          <p class="lead mb-5">The free tools are no good. These tools either crash causing the user to lose their work or have some barrier of entry such as needing to know some basic programming skills. </p>
          <p class="lead mb-5">I aimed to try to solve these problems through Red Tale Narratives.</p>

          <h2>Biggest Challenges?</h2>
          <p></p>
          <p class="lead mb-5">Working with React again. Since I had last used React, it had gone through major updates including functional components and hooks. I attempted to primarily focus on learning this style instead of using component fragments like I had before. This was not smart - I needed to use what was best for the project, not try to force everything into functional components with hooks. </p>
          <p class="lead mb-5">The design work. I am not a designer, but with this project I pushed myself forward to explore the design side of projects. I went out and conducted user research, competitive analysis, and designed my own mockups. I plan on continuing this project well into the future, hopefully with the help of a designer. </p>
