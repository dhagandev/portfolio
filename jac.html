          <h2>What's Just Another Clicker About?</h2>
          <p></p>
          <p class="lead mb-5">Clicker games are idle, incremental games in which the player performs simple actions such as clicking on the screen to earn currency with the eventual evolution that clicking becomes unnecessary after time and the game will play itself in the player's absence.</p>
          <p class="lead mb-5">Just Another Clicker is no exception! In this game, your hero fights off randomly spawned enemies, dealing damage to them over time. When the enemy dies, you earn gold that you can use to buy upgrades or fellow adventurers. Like other idle games, there is no clear "win" state. With clicker games, the win conditions are determined by the player. Whether it is to earn a certain amount of gold, buy all the upgrades, or have a certain amount of companions helping you fight, the goal is yours to decide.</p>

          <h2>Why make a game like this?</h2>
          <p></p>
          <p class="lead mb-5">I love clicker games. I love how relaxing amd casual the play style is. Clickers are probably the game style I play the most.</p>
          <p class="lead mb-5">I wanted to practice responsive design. While it isn't perfect, I did design and develop different layouts for three screen sizes - mobile, tablet, and desktop. The project overall did not reach the responsiveness I desired, but for the week I spent working on this project I am proud of what I accomplished.</p>
          <p class="lead mb-5">While clickers seem like very simple games, behind the scenes they are quite complex. I dive into the complexity in the biggest challenges section below!</p>

          <h2>Biggest Challenges?</h2>
          <p></p>
          <p class="lead mb-5">The responsive design. Responsive design is a huge challenge. I wanted to practice designing and developing for different screen sizes.</p>
          <p class="lead mb-5">Time intervals. It was very interesting to work with different intervals. In this project, I had to set variable intervals for damage being done. Fellow adventurers have different time intervals than the hero, and upgrades can affect the intervals.</p>
          <p class="lead mb-5">Balance. Just Another Clicker is a game and a huge challenge of any game is balancing it so that it is easy enough to jump in and play, but challenging enough to retain a player's attention.</p>
